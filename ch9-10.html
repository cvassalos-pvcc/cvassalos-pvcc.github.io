    <h2>Chapter 9: Introduction to High Level Languages</h2>

    <h3>List four disadvantages of using assembly language:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>The programmer must "manually" manage the movement of data items bewteen and among memory locations and registers (although such data items can be assigned mnemonic names).</li>
            <li>The programmer must take a microscopic view of a task, breaking it down into tiny subtasks-ADD, COMPARE, INCREMENT-that direct what is going on in individual memory locations and registers.</li>
            <li>An assembly language program is machine specific.</li>
            <li>Statements are not natural-language-like (although operations are given mnemonic code words as an improvement over a string of bits).</li>
        </ol>

    <h3>List four expectations programmers have for writing programs in a high-level language ("third generation" language):</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>The programmer need not manage the details of the movement of data items within memory or pay any attention to exactly where those items are stored.</li>
            <li>The programmer can take a macroscopic view of tasks, thinking at a higher level of problem solving (add B and C, and call the result A). The "primitive operations" used as building blocks in algorithm construction can be larger.</li>
            <li>Programs are portable rather than machine specific.</li>
            <li>Programming statements are closer to natural language and use standard mathematical notation.</li>
        </ol>
    
    <h3>Briefly describe or define:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>object code - assembly language instructions translated into binary machine language instructions</li>
            <li>source code - high level language instructions</li>
            <li>procedural language - a type of computer programming language that specifies a series of well-structured steps and procedures within its programming context to compose a program</li>
            <li>Integrated Development Environment (IDE) - a software application that helps a user to write code</li>
            <li>software development life cycle - the multiple steps it takes to create a fully functional piece of software</li>
            <li>waterfall model of software development - a project being broken into numerous parts and completing them sequentially</li>
            <li>agile model of software development - problem specifications are never a "done-deal", so developers must be quick and ready to fix and/or change any code in the project</li>
        </ol>

    <h3>Describe each of these components of the software development life cycle:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>feasibility study - evaluates a proposed project and compares the  costs and benefits of various solutions</li>
            <li>problem specification - developing a clear, concise, and unambiguous statement of the exact problem the software is to solve</li>
            <li>program design - planning how the program is going to the solve the exact problem</li>
            <li>algorithm selection - once the various subtasks have been identified, algorithms must be found to carry them out</li>
            <li>coding - the process of c onverting the detailed designs into computer code</li>
            <li>debugging - the process of locating and correcting program errors</li>
            <li>testing - testing and benchmarking the code throughout the softwares development to make sure there are no errors and everything is working as intended</li>
            <li>verification - can be used to prove that if the input data to a program satisfies certain conditions, then, after the program has been run on this data, the output data satisfies certain other conditions</li>

    <h2>Chapter 10: Tower of Babel: Programming Languages</h2>

    <h3>Questions & Answers:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Why does the textbook refer to "the Tower of Babel" regarding computer languages?</li>
            <li>Similar to the when the Tower of Babel fell, instead of there being just one computer language, there are numerous computer languages</li>

            <li>Why isn't there just one computer programming language?</li>
            <li>The way computer programming languages are designed, some are better for a particular thing, such as accomplishing a certain type of program, or using the smallest amount of memory</li>

            <li>Why didn't FORTRAN use the less than ( < ) symbol when comparing two numbers?</li>
            <li>Because the way data was fed to the FORTRAN machines was via punch cards, and in that time there was no "<" for punch cards</li>

            <li>What was COBOL designed for?</li>
            <li>"Common Business-Oriented Language" was designed to be a language for managers to use in business for such things as managing inventories and payrolls</li>

            <li>Who or what is the language Ada named for, and why?</li>
            <li>The language Ada was named after Ada Augusta Byron Lovelace, the daughter of the poet Lord Byron and later the wife of Lord Lovelace</li>

            <li>What is SQL, and what is it used for?</li>
            <li>SQL (Structered Query Language) is a specialized languange to be used with databases</li>

            <li>What is R and what is it used for?</li>
            <li>R is a specialized programming language designed for statistical computing and graphics</li>

            <li>What is Go (or golang), and what is it used for?</li>
            <li>Go is a programming language developed by Google, designed for the purpose of writing all of Googles services in one language</li>

            <li>What is Swift, and what is it used for?</li>
            <li>Swift is a programming language developed by Apple, designed to build apps and software for Apple's operating systems, iOS and macOS</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Briefly describe each of the following alternative programming paradigms</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>functional programming - building software using only functions, and explicitly explaining each step to the computer to solve the problem`</li>
            <li>logic programming - uses functions like functional programming, but builds on it by using logic to decide what to do instead of explicitly explaining step-by-step what to do</li>
            <li>parallel programming - the most complex of programming, it allows the user to run multiple parts of a program in multiple places</li>
