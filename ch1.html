    <h2>Three misconceptions about Computer Science</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            What a "computer" is. People think computers are desktops or laptops, when in reality
            your phone is a computer, your car has a computer in it, even your microwave has a small
            computer in it.
        </li>
        <li>
            There is a "best" programming language. There are a huge number of computer programming
            languages in the world, and the list continues to grow. While some are much more mainstream
            than others, there is no "magic bullet" language. Some may say Python is the best language
            because it is so flexible, and relatively easy to learn, but for something where memory
            allocation is very important, and the computer is not so powerful (like for a microwave),
            C++ is a much better suited language.
        </li>
        <li>
            Computer Science is "hardcore". This field of study has a reputation of being incredibly hard
            to get into and very difficult to learn. Computer Science is a very diverse field that, if you
            are interested in computers, there is something for everyone. Sure there are the people out there
            that do the incredibly complex things, like designing new CPUs, or writing state of the art code,
            but then theres also people building home PCs for fun, or writing Python script to help their
            fantasy football teams.

    <h2>Briefly define:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Computer Science - the study of the uses and applications of computers and software
        </li>
        <li>
            algorithm - a set of rules/instructions made to solve a task
        </li>
        <li>
            sequential operation - carries out a single, well-defined task, and when done, moves to the next task
        </li>
        <li>
            conditional operation - "question-asking" instructions, what the algorithm does next is based on whether
            something is true or false
        </li>
        <li>
            iterative operation - when an algorithm loops specific instructions until that part of the instructions are
            complete
        </li>
        <li>
            stored computer program - a program that is stored electronically on a computer's hard drive
        </li>
        <li>
            programmer - a human (sometimes AI these days) that writes code for computers
        </li>
        <li>
            integrated circuit - pieces of silicon that have transistors, resistors, and capacitors etched onto them
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Briefly describe these computer generations</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            First generation computer - roughly from 1950 - 1957, these computers were very bulky, slow and unreliable. 
            They used vacuum tubes for logic circuitry. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Second generation computer - (1957 - 1965) the computers became much smaller and more complex. Vacuum tubes 
            were replaced with transistors and magenetic cores began to be used for memory.
        </li>
        <li>
            Third generation computer - (1965 - 1975) the era of the integrated circuit, which reduced the size computers

        </li>
        <li>
            Fourth generation computer - (1975 - 1985) this is the era of the first microcomputer. For the first time, integrated
            circuits had become small enough that you could hold a single circuit board in your hand. Instead of a computer being
            the size of a desk, it became small enough to be on a desk.
        </li>
        <li>
            Fifth generation computer - (1985 - current) the current computer generation, computers have become so small and powerful
            they can fit in your hand (smartphones) and do incredibly complex computations. This current generation of computer has
            changed society as a whole.

    <h2>FORTRAN</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            What does the acronym FORTRAN stand for? - FORTRAN stands for "FORmula TRANslator".
        </li>
        <li>
            When was FORTRAN developed? - It was developed in 1957 by IBM.
        </li>
        <li>
            What was it used for? - It was originally developed for scientifc calculations and other general purpose programming.
        </li>
        <li>
            Is FORTRAN still being used today? If so, what for? - It is still used today for specific computing, such as Doppler weather 
            forecasts, simulating DNA and atomic structures, and even to help farmers breed the most cost effective chickens.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>COBOL</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            What does the acronym COBOL stand for? - COBOL stands for "Common Business Oriented Language".
        </li>
