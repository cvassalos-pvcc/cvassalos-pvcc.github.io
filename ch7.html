    <h3>Briefly describe or define:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>computer network - a set of independent computers interconnected to share resources and information</li>
        <li>
            analog device - is continuous and the quantity the output is determined by the quantity of physical input. 
            A good example is a record player.
        </li>
        <li>
            digital device - non-continuous, meaning it is either on or off, or, determined by 1s or 0s. A good example
            is a CD player.
        </li>
        <li>modem - modulates, or alters, analog data into digital data to be transmitted via network</li>
        <li>bandwith - the rate at which information can be sent and received</li>
        <li>ethernet - the method of connecting computers by wire in a local area network or a wide area network</li>
        <li>WLAN -  a local computer network, made up of two or more devices, that is connected wirelessly</li>
        <li>IEEE 802.11 wireless network standard - a set of techical standards for a local area network, also more commonly known as "Wi-Fi"</li>
        <li>MAN - a medium distance computer network, typically the size of several blocks up to the size of an entire city, MAN stands for "metropolitan area network"</li>
        <li>Internet of Things - everyday objects, that have sensors and an internet connection to connect and share data</li>
        <li>LAN - "local area network", a network connecting computers and devices in a relatively close proximity</li>
        <li>repeater - a device that amplifies and sends a signal forward to strengthen LAN network</li>
        <li>bridge - like a repeater but "smarter", it sends a signal forward based on if the destination is on another "node" or network</li>
        <li>WAN - "wide area network", the widest network that connects computers and devices all accross the world</li>
        <li>
            packet and packet switching - a packet is a unit of transmission with a fixed maximum size in a WAN, and packet switching is when the packet is broken down
            into multiple pieces sent independently to be assembled at the destination device
        </li>
        <li>ISP - "internet service provider", organizations that provide access to the internet for individuals and larger networks</li>
        <li>firewall - hardware and software put in place to prevent unauthorized access to a company's or individual's private data</li>
        <li>protocol - a mutually agreed-upon set of rules, conventions, and agreements for the efficient and orderly exchange of information</li>
        <li>cloud computing - providing software, services, data, and computing on a remote server that a user or company can access through an internet connection</li>
        <li>net neutrality - according to "net neutrality", ISPs must treat all users, all platforms, and all content equally so that there are no "tiers" of the internet
    </ol>

    <h3>Briefly describe the five layers of TCP/IP (the Internet protocol hierarchy):</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Layer 1. Physical layer - protocols that govern the exchange of binary digits across a physical communication channel</li>
        <li>Layer 2. Data link layer - this layer is the protocol layer that transfers data between nodes on a network segment across the physical layer</li>
        <li>Layer 3. Network layer - the network layer is responsible for packet forwarding including routing through intermediate routers</li>
        <li>Layer 4. Transport layer - this layer provides end-to-end communication services for devices</li>
        <li>Layer 5. Application layer - the rules for implementing the end-user services provided by a network </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>List and briefly describe at least 3 network services and benefits:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>e-mail - modern business can not function without email, it is a quick a direct way to send messages to a person, or a whole organization, to 
            collaborate, share ideas, plan, or organzie.</li>
        <li>File Sharing - if there is a file to share with multiple user, this is an incredibly valuable tool. Instead of needing everyone to connect to your 
            device, or pass around a usb or hard drive, you can upload a file to a server online and anyone that needs the data can access it with an internet connection.
        </li>
        <li>Online Gaming - online gaming is a huge hobby, and huge industry today. It enables users to be able to play video games together, and against one another.
            It is a wonderful way for people to stay connected, or to blow off steam after a long day of work.
        </li>
    </ol>
